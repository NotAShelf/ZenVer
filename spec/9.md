# Zen Versioning

_an elegant, post-modern versioning specification for the adventurous that does
not suck[^1]._

---

## Synopsis

ZenVer is a simple, and straightforward versioning specification that demands
nothing from the developer, and less than nothing from the end-user. The
specification can be broken down as follows:

Given a version number `VERSION`, increment the:

1. VERSION version when you make incompatible API changes
2. VERSION version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
3. VERSION version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
4. VERSION version when you change practically anything

No additional labels, titles or subtitles for pre-release and build metadata
shall be appended to the `VERSION` format. Those can be used outside the version
string e.g., in release pages, however it should be avoided in package meta
information.

## Zen Versioning Specification (ZenVer)

The key words **"MUST"**, **"MUST NOT"**, **"REQUIRED"**, **"SHALL"**, **"SHALL
NOT"**, **"SHOULD"**, **"SHOULD NOT"**, **"RECOMMENDED"**, **"MAY"**, and
**"OPTIONAL"** in this document are to be interpreted as you choose to interpret
them as.

> Remember that this specification is a suggestion, and your feelings are more
> important than a silly document that tells you what to do.

1. Zen versioned software MUST always use positive integers.

2. Software using Zen Versioning MAY declare a public API. This public API MAY
   be declared in the code itself, or exist strictly in documentation. If it is
   done, it MAY be precise and comprehensive. This is RECOMMENDED, but not
   enforced.

3. A normal version number SHOULD take the form `X` where `X` is a non-negative
   integer, and MAY consider zeroes. `X` is the version. This element MAY
   increase numerically. For instance: `1` -> `2` -> `3`. Alternatively: `1` ->
   `4` -> `5`

4. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version
   SHOULD NOT be modified, however, it MAY be modified. Any modifications SHALL
   be released as a new version, however, that is not enforced.

5. All versions are for development. Everything MUST change. The public API MAY
   be considered stable.

6. Version `1` defines absolutely nothing at all. They are numbers, you MUST NOT
   assign arbitrary meaning to numbers on your screen.

7. When displaying a version, a one letter prefix (`z`) MAY be prepended to the
   version. It is NOT required.

8. In order to differentiate from other versioning schemes, the one letter
   prefix (`v`) MUST NOT be used.

## Why Use Zen Versioning?

This is, unlike Semantic Versioning, a new and a revolutionary idea. In fact,
you probably never did something remotely close to this before. The (biggest)
problem here is that you are unimaginative, and formal specifications are
boring.

Zen Versioning establishes a simple and straightforward specification that
communicates your intentions to the users of your software. Those intentions
are, and always have been clear: number go up, software go new.

As a responsible developer you will, of course, want to make sure that any
package upgrade makes sense from the get go.

> Number go _up_ = upgrade.

The real world is a messy place, and the world of software development is worse.
What you can do to remedy the unfortunate status quo is to follow a _sane_
versioning specification while releasing and upgrading packages.

> Larger is greater, greater is larger. Larger number means better software.

## FAQ

### How should I deal with revisions in the X for initial development phase?

Start with 1. Increment by one every time you change something. Increment by one
whenever you feel like. Your software will never be final, and the version
should always reflect that.

### How do I know when to release 1?

If your software exists, then it's good to go. Release it, what are you waiting
for?

### Doesn't this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?

No. Are you illiterate?

### If even the tiniest backward incompatible changes to the public API require version bump, won't I end up at version 42 very rapidly?

You will, and that is a good thing. Larger number means better software, and you
will almost certainly never run out of numbers to assign to your software.

### Documenting the entire public API is too much work!

Then don't, nobody cares.

### What do I do if I accidentally release a backward incompatible change?

Release a new version.

### What should I do if I update my own dependencies without changing the public API?

Increment version by one. Two if you feel brave that day, or alternatively bump
the same number as the dependencies you have updated.

### How should I handle deprecating functionality?

If a given version of a release is below latest available version, then that
version is deprecated.

> _No takesies backsies_.

Here is a useful illustration for the less mathematically inclined:

```
Latest version: 15
Your version: 13
```

This means your version is deprecated. That is because, believe it or not, 15 is
larger than 13.

### How should I communicate breaking changes?

_You_ shouldn't. The entire specification of ZenVer seeks to be
self-explanatory. Larger number means newer software. Users are to expect
breakage in each version[^2].

> Let the users do the heavy lifting for you!

### Does ZenVer have a size limit on the version string?

Nope. You can have an 12 billion character version for all I care. If you find
yourself running out of numbers, then consider that your software may be too
good.

### Is `v1` a valid zen version?

No, because in ZenVer it is required to prefix versions with a `z` instead of
`v`; however, using only a number is still allowed. In an identical case, `z1`
and `1` would both conform to ZenVer spec.

### Is there a suggested regular expression (RegEx) to check a ZenVer string?

Yeah just check if it's a number, optionally prefixed with `z`.

My cat rolling on my keyboard has conjured the following expression:

```regex
^(z)?\d+$
```

### How is this any different compared to to SemVer?

Zen Versioning ("ZenVer") is SemVer, if it had _only_ the MAJOR patch version
and if everything else was omitted.

A ZenVer release from 3 -> is just a SemVer release from 3.0.0 to 4.0.0.

## Examples

- Case one: your software, currently versioned `3`, has received a complete
  refactor.

```
Version: 3 -> 4
```

- Case two: an example software, currently at version `z45` has breaking API
  changes.

```
Version: z45 -> z46
```

## About

The Zen version has been conjured in roughly 3 minutes as a joke, however, it
made too much sense to discard. This has lead to the release of specification
**v1**. ZenVer draws inspiration from [SemVer](https://semver.org) and
[ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/), but addresses their limitations[^3].

[^1]:
    This is software. Strictly speaking, it _does not have the ability to
    suck_.

[^2]:
    You might have seen the recent changes to `keepassxc` in Debian Sid
    repositories where users were blamed for not reading arbitrary NEWS files of
    their distribution. We think users are to be blamed even more, so we doubled
    down on this approach.

    Which there are a lot of. Although it would be reasonable to address each
    one of those limitations, I will not be doing that. Should be obvious by now
    that this not a serious document.
