# Zen Versioning

_an elegant, post-modern versioning specification for the adventurous that does
not suck[^1]._

---

## Motivation

The field of software development has long been littered with overcomplicated
versioning specifications that seem to be invented solely to waste the
developers' time by inventing made-up requirements that, in truth, nobody has
the time to follow. Developers are busy people.

We should consider not only that it takes time to calculate version numbers, but
also that it takes mental strain: counting is hard. We do not want to spend time
and effort that could be spent developing software on devising versions for our
software.

> You will never need to ask yourself "do I need to bump minor or major?" You
> will simply write software.

ZenVer was created to address the poor design choices of prior, unaffiliated
specifications by proposing (but not enforcing) a simple, _zen_, specification
that works anywhere, for anyone. It also removes the need to conjure up new,
even dumber specifications a total of 7 people will use.

> In other words, one spec to rule them all!

## Synopsis

ZenVer is a simple, and straightforward versioning specification that demands
nothing from the developer, and less than nothing from the end-user. The
specification can be broken down as follows:

Given a version number `VERSION`, increment the:

1. VERSION version when you make incompatible API changes
2. VERSION version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
3. VERSION version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
4. VERSION version when you change practically anything

No additional labels, titles or subtitles for pre-release and build metadata
shall be appended to the `VERSION` format. Those can be used outside the version
string e.g., in release pages, however it should be avoided in package meta
information.

## Introduction

> In the world of software management there exists a dreaded place called
> "dependency hell." The bigger your system grows and the more packages you
> integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one
> day, in this pit of despair.

> In systems with many dependencies, releasing new package versions can quickly
> become a nightmare. If the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in
> danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to
> release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are
> specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity
> (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable).
> Dependency hell is where you are when version lock and/or version promiscuity
> prevent you from easily and safely moving your project forward.

> As a solution to this problem, we propose a simple set of rules and
> requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented.
> These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existing
> widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software.
> For this system to work, you first need to declare a public API. This may
> consist of documentation or be enforced by the code itself. Regardless, it is
> important that this API be clear and precise. Once you identify your public
> API, you communicate changes to it with specific increments to your version
> number. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not
> affecting the API increment the patch version, backward compatible API
> additions/changes increment the minor version, and backward incompatible API
> changes increment the major version.

> We call this system "Semantic Versioning." Under this scheme, version numbers

On paper, this all seems great. Except for one problem: all of that is
**bullshit**[^2]. The clear solution, as most of my peers who have formerly
worked on designing a good versioning specification fail to realise[^3], is to
avoid complications while versioning our software, and obviously, to increment
`VERSION` every time you make a change to remain as straightforward as possible.
To remain Zen.

> API documentation this, minor revision that. BULLSHIT[^4].

We will see that the underlying problem in existing versioning specifications is
that there is no good, consistent specification that is not demanding of the
developer. Consistency comes from simplicity, and we cannot achieve neither
simplicity nor consistency with those overcomplicated specifications that
require more from the developer.

> `0.40.3`? `1.5.0`? You hit your head pretty hard, get up we are going back to
> _proper_ versioning.

To all problems previously (poorly) addressed by SemVer and ZeroVer, ZenVer
proposes a simple set of rules that are based on _necessarily_ pre-existing
widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software[^5].

For this system to work, you must know _how numbers work_[^6]. That is about
all, you need not to document anything, nor to enforce it by the code itself.

Once you identify your own software (i.e. software that you are working on),
which should not be _too_ difficult, you may consider a version format of `X`
(VERSION). Bug fixes increment the VERSION by one, backward compatible API
additions/changes increment the VERSION by one, and backward incompatible
incompatible API changes increment the VERSION by one. In fact, anything
increments the VERSION by one. A butterfly flapping wings on the other side of
the earth may increment VERSION by one if you are not careful.

> While incrementing by one is the common practice in Zenver, we acknowledge the
> needs of a developer and propose that if you are, in any given time, feeling a
> bit down, then you may consider bumping VERSION arbitrarily to feel better.

In former iterations of this specification, some users that _major_[^7] changes
do not impose the sense of importance that they need to. To that, ZenVer's
answer is incrementing: not by one, but by two (or perhaps more) depending on
how major the change really is.

> Our motivation? Two is larger than one.

## Zen Versioning Specification (ZenVer)

The key words **"MUST"**, **"MUST NOT"**, **"REQUIRED"**, **"SHALL"**, **"SHALL
NOT"**, **"SHOULD"**, **"SHOULD NOT"**, **"RECOMMENDED"**, **"MAY"**, and
**"OPTIONAL"** in this document are to be interpreted as you choose to interpret
them as.

> Remember that this specification is a suggestion, and your feelings are more
> important than a silly document that tells you what to do.

1. Zen versioned software MUST always use positive integers.

2. Software using Zen Versioning MAY declare a public API. This public API MAY
   be declared in the code itself, or exist strictly in documentation. If it is
   done, it MAY be precise and comprehensive. This is RECOMMENDED, but not
   enforced.

3. A normal version number SHOULD take the form `X` where `X` is a non-negative
   integer, and MAY consider zeroes. `X` is the version. This element MAY
   increase numerically. For instance: `1` -> `2` -> `3`. Alternatively: `1` ->
   `4` -> `5`

4. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version
   SHOULD NOT be modified, however, it MAY be modified. Any modifications SHALL
   be released as a new version, however, that is not enforced.

5. All versions are for development. Everything MUST change. The public API MAY
   be considered stable.

6. Version `1` defines absolutely nothing at all. They are numbers, you MUST NOT
   assign arbitrary meaning to numbers on your screen.

7. When displaying a version, a one letter prefix (`z`) MAY be prepended to the
   version. It is NOT required.

8. In order to differentiate from other versioning schemes, the one letter
   prefix (`v`) MUST NOT be used.

## Why Use Zen Versioning?

This is, unlike Semantic Versioning, a new and a revolutionary idea. In fact,
you probably never did something remotely close to this before. The (biggest)
problem here is that you are unimaginative, and formal specifications are
boring.

Zen Versioning establishes a simple and straightforward specification that
communicates your intentions to the users of your software. Those intentions
are, and always have been clear: number go up, software go new.

As a responsible developer you will, of course, want to make sure that any
package upgrade makes sense from the get go.

> Number go _up_ = upgrade.

The real world is a messy place, and the world of software development is worse.
What you can do to remedy the unfortunate status quo is to follow a _sane_
versioning specification while releasing and upgrading packages.

> Larger is greater, greater is larger. Larger number means better software.

## FAQ

### How should I deal with revisions in the X for initial development phase?

Start with 1. Increment by one every time you change something. Increment by one
whenever you feel like. Your software will never be final, and the version
should always reflect that.

### How do I know when to release 1?

If your software exists, then it's good to go. Release it, what are you waiting
for?

### Doesn't this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?

No. Are you illiterate?

### If even the tiniest backward incompatible changes to the public API require version bump, won't I end up at version 42 very rapidly?

You will, and that is a good thing. Larger number means better software, and you
will almost certainly never run out of numbers to assign to your software.

### Documenting the entire public API is too much work!

Then don't, nobody cares.

### What do I do if I accidentally release a backward incompatible change?

Release a new version.

### What should I do if I update my own dependencies without changing the public API?

Increment version by one. Two if you feel brave that day, or alternatively bump
the same number as the dependencies you have updated.

### How should I handle deprecating functionality?

If a given version of a release is below latest available version, then that
version is deprecated.

> _No takesies backsies_.

Here is a useful illustration for the less mathematically inclined:

```
Latest version: 15
Your version: 13
```

This means your version is deprecated. That is because, believe it or not, 15 is
larger than 13.

### How should I communicate breaking changes?

_You_ shouldn't. The entire specification of ZenVer seeks to be
self-explanatory. Larger number means newer software. Users are to expect
breakage in each version[^7].

> Let the users do the heavy lifting for you!

### Does ZenVer have a size limit on the version string?

Nope. You can have an 12 billion character version for all I care. If you find
yourself running out of numbers, then consider that your software may be too
good.

### Is `v1` a valid zen version?

No, because in ZenVer it is required to prefix versions with a `z` instead of
`v`; however, using only a number is still allowed. In an identical case, `z1`
and `1` would both conform to ZenVer spec.

### Is there a suggested regular expression (RegEx) to check a ZenVer string?

Yeah just check if it's a number, optionally prefixed with `z`.

My cat rolling on my keyboard has conjured the following expression:

```regex
^(z)?\d+$
```

### How is this any different compared to to SemVer?

Zen Versioning ("ZenVer") is SemVer, if it had _only_ the MAJOR patch version
and if everything else was omitted.

A ZenVer release from 3 -> is just a SemVer release from 3.0.0 to 4.0.0.

## Examples

- Case one: your software, currently versioned `3`, has received a complete
  refactor.

```
Version: 3 -> 4
```

- Case two: an example software, currently at version `z45` has breaking API
  changes.

```
Version: z45 -> z46
```

## About

The Zen version has been conjured in roughly 3 minutes as a joke, however, it
made too much sense to discard. This has lead to the release of specification
**v1**. ZenVer draws inspiration from [SemVer](https://semver.org) and
[ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/), but addresses their limitations[^8].

    If this has not yet been made obvious to you, then I feel responsible for
    informing you that **this is a joke**. I harbor no ill will towards SemVer
    or any other versioning specification. Though, I prefer ZeroVer over SemVer because
    it has a more interesting premise. You will find obvious references to the
    ideas behind both specifications.

[^3]:
    Once again, this is a joke. Better men than me have worked on versioning
    specifications, and this is mostly a joke. Unless?

[^4]:
    [An obvious Max0r reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkLYPCJogzM)

    We should probably learn about versioning from Microsoft. Confused? Take a
    look at Windows' versioning scheme. At the time of writing, the latest
    supported revision is `22631.3527`. What the hell does that even mean?

[^6]:
    If you have having trouble with this, then there is not much I can do for
    you. May I suggest revising on your elementary school mathematics?

[^7]:
    You might have seen the recent changes to `keepassxc` in Debian Sid
    repositories where users were blamed for not reading arbitrary NEWS files of
    their distribution. We think users are to be blamed even more, so we doubled
    down on this approach.

[^8]:
    You should ask yourself: how major is my major change? If it's more major
    than major, then increase the number in accordance. If it's less major than
    major, then repeat above instructions. I think I'm repeating myself here.

[^9]:
    Which there are a lot of. Although it would be reasonable to address
    each one of those limitations, I will not be doing that. Should be
    obvious by now that this not a serious document.
