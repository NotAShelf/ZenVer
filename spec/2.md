# Zen Versioning

A post-modern versioning scheme for the adventurous.

---

## Summary

Given a version number `VERSION`, increment the:

1. VERSION version when you make incompatible API changes
2. VERSION version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
3. VERSION version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
4. VERSION version when you change practically anything

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
to the `VERSION` format.

― From [https://semver.org](https://semver.org/#introduction)

Yeah well you see, all of that is bullshit. The clear solution to avoid
complications while versioning our software, obviously, is to increment
`VERSION` every time you make a change.

The problem in versioning specifications is that there is no good, consistent
scheme that is not demanding of the developer. API documentation this,
versioning scheme that. BULLSHIT.

Consistency comes from simplicity, and we cannot achieve eitheer of those with
overly complicated specifications that require more from the developer.
`0.40.3`? `1.5.0`? You hit your head pretty hard, get up we are going back to
_proper_ versioning.

To all problems previously (poorly) addressed by Semver, I propose a simple set
of rules that are based on _necessarily_ limited to pre-existing widespread
common practices in use in both closed and open-source software[^1]. For this
system to work, you must know how numbers work. You need not to document
anything, or enforce it by the code itself. Once you identify your own software,
which is not too difficult, then you may consider a version format of `X`
(VERSION). Bug fixes increment the VERSION by one, backward compatible API
additions/changes increment the VERSION and backward incompatible incompatible
API changes increment the VERSION. In fact, anything increments the VERSION. If
you are feeling a bit down on that particular day, you may consider bumping
VERSION to feel a bit better.

Some may be concerned that major changes do not impose a sense of importance on
the user, and to that I propose incrementing Version _by two_. Because two is
larger than one, believe it or not.

## Zen Versioning Specification (ZenVer)

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as you wish to interpret them as.

1. Software using Zen Versioning MAY declare a public API. This API MAY be
   declared in the code itself, or exist strictly in documentation. If it is
   done, it MAY be precise and comprehensive

2. A normal version number SHOULD take the form `X` where `X` is a non-negative
   integer, and MAY consider zeroes. `X` is the version. This element MAY
   increase numerically. For instance: `1` -> `2` -> `3`

3. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version
   SHOULD NOT be modified, however, it MAY be modified. Any modifications SHALL
   be released as a new version, however, that is not enforced.

4. All versions are for development. Anything MUST change. The public API may be
   considered stable.

5. Version `1` defines absolutely nothing at all. They are numbers, you MUST NOT
   assign arbitrary meaning to numbers on your screen.

6. Zen versioned software MUST always use positive integers.

## Why Use Zen Versioning?

This is, unlike Semantic Versioning, a new and a revolutionary idea. In fact,
you probably never did something remotely close to this before. The (biggest)
problem here is that you are unimaginative, and formal specifications are
boring.

Zen Versioning establishes a simple and straightforward specification that
communicates your intentions to the users of your software. Those intentions
are, and always have been clear: number go up, software go new.

As a responsiblee developer you will, of course, want to make sure that any
package upgrade makes sense from the get go. Number go up = upgrade. The real
world is a messy place, and the world of software development is worse.

What you can do to remedy the unfortunate status quo is to follow a _sane_
versioning specification while releasing and upgrading packages.

## FAQ

### How should I deal with revisions in the X for initial development phase?

Start with 0. Increment by one every time you change something. Increment by one
whenever you feel like. Your software will never be final, and the version
should reflect that.

### How do I know when to release 1?

If your software exists, then it's good to go. Release it, what are you waiting
for?

### Doesn't this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?

No.

### If even the tiniest backward incompatible changes to the public API require version bump, won't I end up at version 42 very rapidly?

You will, and that is a good thing. Larger number means better software, and you
will almost certainly never run out of numbers to assign to your software.

### Documenting the entire public API is too much work!

Then don't, nobody cares.

### What do I do if I accidentally release a backward incompatible change?

Release a new version.

### What should I do if I update my own dependencies without changing the public API?

Increment version by one. Two if you feel brave that day, or alternatively bump
the same number as the dependencies you have updated.

### How should I handle deprecating functionality?

If version of a release is below latest version, then that version is
deprecated. Here is a useful illustration for the less mathematically inclined:

```
Latest version: 15
Your version: 13
```

This means your version is deprecated. That is because 15 is larger than 13.

### Does ZenVer have a size limit on the version string?

Nope. You can have an 12 billion character version for all I care. If you find
yourself running out of numbers, then consider that your software may be too
good.

### Is "v1" a valid zen version?

Yes, because you see `v` usually refers to `version` and in this example 1 is
the version. For anyone with common sense, that is a valid version.

### Is there a suggested regular expression (RegEx) to check a SemVer string?

Yeah just check if it's a number.

## About

The Semantic Versioning specification was originally authored by
[Tom Preston-Werner](https://tom.preston-werner.com), inventor of Gravatar and
cofounder of GitHub.

The Zen version has been conjured in roughly 3 minutes as a joke, however, it
made too much sense to discard. This has lead to the release of specification
**v1**.

ZenVer draws inspiration from [SemVer](https://semver.org) and
[ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/), but addresses their limitations[^2].
