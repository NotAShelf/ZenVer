# About Zen Versioning Spec ("ZenVer")

Zen Versioning, "Zen Ver" or "ZenVer" is an alternative versioning spec that
aims to be simple, elegant or "zen".

## Why make a new spec?

It's funny.

## What does `z` in versions stand for?

It's short for "zersion".

## Can I contribute?

Sure, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Is this serious? Can I use it?

No, and yes. ZenVer is a joke, plain and simple. But you are welcome to use it
for any project that you might want to version in a straightforward manner.
