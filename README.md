# Zen Versioning Specification

"Zen Versioning" or "Zen Ver" contains a set of rules and requirements that make
suggestions on how version numbers are assigned and incremented. You can find
the full document in [spec](spec).

## Contributing

ZenVer is considered stable at the mature version of **1**, but sane suggestions
may be considered. Please create a Pull Request, should you wish to improve the
specification.
